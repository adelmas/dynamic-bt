Here is a 3 step install process:

1) Create an appropriate directory and extract the files 
   from HDTrans' source tarball

2) make

3) export HDTRANS_SODIR=`pwd`
   This environment variable is needed by the HDTrans script.
   You may consider adding:
       export HDTRANS_SODIR=<current directory>
   to your .bash_profile file.

To run a program under HDTrans' control,

HDTrans <program name>
